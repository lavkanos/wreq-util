## Features

**wreq-util** offers a set of [tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) middleware and utilities designed specifically for the [wreq](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq) HTTP client:

- **Emulation** various mainstream browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, OkHttp) and their versions.
- **Delay/JitterDelay**: Add fixed or jittered delays to HTTP [request](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/index.html) with customizable strategies and predicates.

Chrome 150 and newer advertise ML-DSA signature algorithms. Chrome 152
also enables signature algorithm GREASE and sends an empty `trust_anchors`
extension by default. Enable `emulation-chromium-pki` to send Chromium's Trust
Anchor IDs and enable wreq's matching Chromium root store. A custom certificate
store must trust the requested anchors. The bundled roots do not provide
Chromium's complete certificate verification policy.

The workspace patches wreq and its TLS backend to pinned development commits
for this API. Keep these patches when building the unreleased changes.

## Example

The following example uses the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) runtime with optional features enabled by adding this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
wreq = "0.16"
wreq-util = "0.2"
```

And then the code:

```rust
use wreq::Client;
use wreq_util::Emulation;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> wreq::Result<()> {
    // Build a client
    let client = Client::builder()
        .emulation(Emulation::Chrome147)
        .build()?;

    // Use the API you're already familiar with
    let resp = client.get("https://pingly.us.kg/api/all").send().await?;
    println!("{}", resp.text().await?);
    Ok(())
}
```
